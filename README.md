# Tensorflow
We tried to put together all the functions and classes as described, but cannot combine all these steps to realize a working backpropagation. It is a mix between a lack of understanding in the endstages and implementation issues, where we often get either errors regarding the parameters/arguments we give to the different functions or shape mismatches.
